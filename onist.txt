Open Issues:

* Persistence of the mongodb pod on restart is not taken care of. (It can be done by mapping volumes)
* Exponential retries for the db connection is not taken into account
* No security is build into the system.
* Docker images are build locally, it should ideally be driven out of Jenkins or CircleCI
* kubectl for kubernetes uploads keys to AWS from local machine. So all the deployment interaction happens from my mac
